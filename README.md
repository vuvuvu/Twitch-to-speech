# **[TTSpeech - Twitch Chat Text-to-Speech](https://vuvuvu.github.io/Twitch-to-speech/)**


A browser-based [Text-to-Speech](https://vuvuvu.github.io/Twitch-to-speech/) application that reads Twitch chat messages aloud using your system's available voices. It allows you to quickly follow the chat without having to read it, making it useful while driving (in-game or real life!), walking, or any situation where your eyes need to be focused elsewhere. It's also great for streamers who want to hear their chat while focusing on gameplay.
